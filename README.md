# Pwsh Unofficial Theme

This is an unofficial Dark theme for PowerShell. I built this theme to look nice and provide better syntax highlighting when working with PowerShell.

If you would like to suggest some changes to this theme, please open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/TheTaylorLee/pwsh-theme-unofficial). Issues that reference specific editor tokens and color codes will be considered.
