# Pwsh Unofficial Theme

This is an unofficial Dark theme for PowerShell. I built this theme out of a desire for a theme that looks nice and provides better syntax highlighting when working with powershell.

If you would like to suggest some changes to this theme, please open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/TheTaylorLee/pwsh-theme-unofficial). Issues that reference specific rules and color codes in the [theme's template](https://github.com/TheTaylorLee/pwsh-theme-unofficial/blob/master/themes/Pwsh%20Theme%20Unofficial-color-theme.json) will be considered.
