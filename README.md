This is an unofficial Dark theme for PowerShell. I built this theme to be code focused and provide better syntax highlighting when working with PowerShell.

If you would like to suggest some changes to this theme, or an additional theme to be included, please open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/TheTaylorLee/pwsh-theme-unofficial). Issues that reference specific editor tokens and color codes will be considered. An easy way to identify various token themes is to use [Theme Studio](https://themes.vscode.one/theme/TheTaylorLee/nrtbsad6). You can fork my theme and get the various tokens and color codes that way. Alternatively editor tokens can be inspected using Ctrl+Shift+P in vscode.
